# My Own Token for NFT Collection CryptoDevs

Firstly! Check out my own NFT Collection on OpenSea.

Created token for my own NFT Collection **CryptoDevs**. Where the cryptodevs NFT holders 
will get **10 free tokens**, but they would have to pay Gas fees for it. 
A full Website is created where users can visit for the **ICO** (Initial Coin Offering). 
As we are creating Tokens for NFT, we will create ERC20 tokens. 
## ‚öôÔ∏è Working

* Used Oppenzeppelin framework to build secure smart contracts, using **ownable.sol** contract from openzeppelin which helps you to manage the ownership of the contract. **ownable.sol** let's you **transfer** and **renounce** ownership.  
* Built Smart contract using **hardhat**, used ERC721 extension known as **ERC721 enumerable**
* creating interface for whitelist contract (as we would not need to inherit and deploy the entire whitelist but only a part of it). 
* installed **dotenv** package to be able to import **.env** files and use it in our config 
* we will deploy our contract on Ethereum on **Goerli Network** using **QuickNode** (A lightning-fast global API provides instant access to Ethereum, Bitcoin & xDai networks.)
* Exporting *quicknode_http_url* and *private_key* in our **.env** file. 
* set up the goerli network on **hardhat.config.js** (so we can deploy our contract to goerli network) 
* Making website for my NFT Collection using **React.js** and **NEXT.js** 
* Exporting **NFT_CONTRACT_ABI**, **NFT_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**, **TOKEN_CONTRACT_ABI**, **TOKEN_CONTRACT_ADDRESS**
* Deployed website on vercel
